Romeo sat by the river, tossing pebbles into the water. Each ripple reminded him of choices—how one small act could spread so far. Years had passed since Verona, yet the memories still burned like candle flames that refused to die.

He had left his old life behind—the feuds, the swords, the endless tragedy. In a quiet village by the hills, he built a small garden and learned to find peace in things that grew, not things that bled.

One morning, while tending his roses, he met a girl who hummed while gathering herbs by the path. Her name was Livia. She smiled like dawn breaking after a long storm. She didn’t know who he was, and he didn’t tell her. For the first time, Romeo didn’t want to be a name in a story.

As days turned to months, laughter replaced silence. Romeo found that love didn’t always have to be dramatic—it could be quiet, steady, like the rhythm of rain on the roof.

He still thought of Juliet sometimes, not with pain, but gratitude. She had taught him that love, even lost, could make a heart softer, not harder.

And so, under the same stars that once watched over Verona, Romeo finally found something he never thought possible—peace.
